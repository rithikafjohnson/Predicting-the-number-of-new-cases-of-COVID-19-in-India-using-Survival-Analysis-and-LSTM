**Predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in India using Survival Analysis and LSTM**

Abstract:
COVID-19 has been the cause of death for  thousands of  people across the globe. The goal of this study is to forecast the new COVID-19 cases in India.  The other methods used to forecast COVID-19 cases fail to give results with good accuracy when they try to forecast the number of new cases for a long period of time or when the number of daily cases reported is large since the population of a country is large. In this study we tackle this problem by firstly, customizing our dataset. Secondly, by choosing the suitable covariates using survival analysis and thirdly, feeding the data to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. The data between 30th January, 2020 to 16th June, 2021 was taken to estimate the number of new cases everyday for the next 28 days with a mean absolute percentage error of 5.79%.
